# First Express Assignment
## An assignment to create a new node / express project

Create an express app which sends requests through 2 middleware functions that both log something to the console and return one response 

Handle requests to both / and /users so that each only has one middleware that does something with the request (send simple html) and removes the bogus extra middleware (app.use)
